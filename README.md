# A Comprehensive Analysis of Healthcare Trends for Improved Efficiency
## Problem statement:
In the healthcare sector, managing patient care, hospital operations, and financial performance requires efficient decision-making supported by accurate data insights. However, many hospitals face challenges in analysing large datasets, identifying key trends, and optimizing resources effectively. The goal is to provide healthcare administrators and decision-makers with actionable insights that improve patient care, optimize hospital operations, reduce costs, and enhance overall healthcare delivery.
## objective:

## Insights:
1. The gender distribution of patients shows that 53% of patients are female, while 47% are male.
2. Ibuprofen is the most commonly prescribed medication, followed by Penicillin, with Lipitor being the least common.
3. The most common age group for patients is adults aged 31-45.
4. Arthritis is the most frequent medical condition among admitted patients.
5. On average, 25 patients are admitted per day.
6. Diabetes accounts for 16% of the total billing amount, while obesity represents 17%.
7. Blood group distribution shows that A+ and A- are the most common among patients, while O- is the least frequent.
8. Test results indicate that 45% patients have normal results, 33% have abnormal results, and 22% have inconclusive results.


## Conclusion:
The hospital sees a balanced gender distribution with a higher number of female patients and a predominant age group of 31-45 years, with arthritis being the most common condition. Ibuprofen and Penicillin are the top medications, guiding treatment protocols. Billing is notably high for conditions like diabetes and obesity, which are major contributors to revenue. A+ and A- blood types are most common, influencing blood supply needs. With most test results being normal, there is a need to focus on abnormal or inconclusive results for better patient care.
